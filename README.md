# pandas-challenge
This challenge is an analyisis of students grades in several different schools and how the grades of the students are affected by by their environment.
Grade level, budget, school spending, school type, and size are the categories by which this analysis has been made. From this data, we can conclude that
charter schools have a much bigger advantage when it comes to overall passing rate percentage. Charter schools overall percentage was %90.4 while district
schools were only at %53.6.
When we compare math with reading, we can conclude that reading scores are almost always higher regardless of spending, size, type, etc.
